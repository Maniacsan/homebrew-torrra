# homebrew-torrra
## Install
```brew tap Maniacsan/homebrew-torrra && brew install torrra```

## Upgrade
```brew uninstall torrra && brew tap Maniacsan/homebrew-torrra && brew install torrra```

## Why a binary?
I personally have problems with using python with homebrew and since there is a binary option for torrra I choose to go with that.
